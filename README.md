# JavaScript-Drum-Kit
We all must have seen a drum kit in some concert or elsewhere, it is a collection of drums, cymbals and other percussion instruments. But have you ever imagined making that drum kit on your own virtually with the help of some scripting language? Well, so here we are with the goal for this article to build a drum kit app that runs in the browser. The main concepts presented in the article are DOM, key events and CSS animations. So by the end of this article, you would have not only understood how to add event listeners to buttons and keystrokes so that you’ll know when the user is tapping on the keyboard or clicking on a particular button on your Website and you can respond to it, but you also end up with an awesome Website that you can impress all of your friends with.

So the way this website would work that we’ve got a number of keys on the webpage that represents different drums in a typical drum set and when you click on any of those buttons then you’ll get the corresponding sound of the drum. And in addition you can also use the keys on the keyboard to have a sound effect.
